# Draw The Word

This is nothing but a `Pictionary` game. Pictionary is a super simple game that only requires pen, paper *(In this case screen and a mouse)*. The aim of `Draw The Word` is to guess what the drawer, who is drawing the word after selecting from a list of words. 
Each player will get their turns one after the other and score is assigned to the player who guesses the word first. Minimum number of players is not required, but atleast have 3 people in room to have fun (Currently we did not add any restriction over maximum players in a room for Draw The Word game). So, have Fun.
