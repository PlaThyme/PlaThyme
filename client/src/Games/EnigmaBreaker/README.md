# __ENIGMA BREAKER__
This is a game where two teams complete to decipher each others hidden codes. Since this game is multiplayer, and a social game, getting everyone together on voice chat app of some kind is recommended. Use whatever you like, I prefer discord.

# __Understanding the UI__
![ebguide](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53237662/128276359-056d0779-1e68-4acb-b569-33db20181a19.png)
1. These are your teams secret words. Their color indicates what team you are on. The opposing team has different words. The number indicates their relation to the secret codes.
2. Secret code box contains the numbers that the encoder must create hints for. These numbers match the secret words, and thus the hints need to go with them as well.
3. Decoder control box is where guesses for the meaning of the secret words must go. Each row must have a different number selected for the guesses to be submitted. When the guesses have been submitted this box will only show what your team submitted.
4. This is where the encoder creates their hints, and after both teams have submitted their hints, where they will be displayed to everyone. 
5. This is the status area. It will show you helpful tips on what to do next, what the game is waiting on, or error messages if incorrect input is received. This may appear on the other side depending on what team you are on.
6. Team chat is a limited comms between you and your teammates. This is so you can secretly collaborate on decoding the encrypted hints. It is limited to one line at a time though. 
7. The print history buttons will display the hints that each team has been given for each round, and what the team guessed it would be.
8. The history printout, each column is associated with a secret word. Leftmost column his history for word #1, and rightmost is word #4. This is critical to uncovering the other teams secret words, and decoding their hints. Since you don't know the words associated with each hint, you can view what they wrote down to try to guess what they meant. In this example, you can see that "Elephant Trunk" was in Red's #1 column... Could trunk have anything to do with the steering wheel hint displayed above? Maybe their secret word has something to do with a car? As more rounds go by and more history is produced, you can use this to find patterns.

# __How to Play__
## __Goal__
The goal of the game is to decipher your opponents hidden words while keeping your own secret.
The game ends when one of the following happens:
- One team breaks the enemy code twice. These are called Hits :üíæ: -- This team wins.
- One team fails to decode their own message twice. These are called Misses :‚ò†Ô∏è: -- This team loses.
- The end of round 8 comes, and neither team has achieved one of the above conditions.

If the game ends for multiple reasons at the same time, a tie breaker is used. Hits are worth +1 point, misses are -1 point. Team with the most points wins in this case.

## __Overview of Game__

The game is played over a maximum of 8 rounds. 

Each round one member of each team will receive a secret code. The person on each round who holds the secret code will be referred to as the 'encoder'. This is because its their job to encode the secret message into a series of hints that will lead their teammates to deciphering the hidden code. Rules for doing this are described below. 

Once the hints have been created each team must work together to guess the secret code that matches the hints that they were given. There's a team chat box that only goes to their teammates to help facilitate secret communications. On the first round, you will be guessing only on your own secret code. In subsequent rounds you will be able to guess on what numbers go with the other teams hints too.

When both teams have guessed, the results for the round are displayed. If the game has ended, the winner is indicated in the status area.

## __Detailed Round Structure__
When the game starts you need to wait until each team has at least two players. When you have reached the minimum the game can be started. Players can join after the game has started, as well as leave. If the number of players on a team drops to one, the game can't proceed past most rounds until a 2nd player for that team joins. If everyone from one team leaves, the game simply ends and players are given the opportunity to switch up the teams and start a new game.

1. The first part of a round is the __encoding phase__. During this part each teams encoder must take the secret code that they have been given and come up with hints for their team to get them to guess the secret code. If you haven't been given the secret code, you just need to wait during this phase. The code corresponds to the numbers next to the secret words at the top. The hints should be created with the following restrictions:
   * The hints must not contain the secret word its self.
   * The hint has to be publicly available information. It can be obscure, but it can't be something that only you and your team know. Such as the contents of a converstation that you and your teammates had before the game. For example, you can reference an obscure song that you and your teammate know, but you can't reference the trip to Memphis you just took and only had told your teammates about.
   * The hint can't be in reference to the placement of the word in the list, or its number.
2. Next is the __decoding phase__. This is where each team tries to guess what secret code their encoder was given. Additionally they must try to break the other teams code using the hints that they have seen about their codes. If you're the encoder you can help break the enemy code, but not your own, as you know it.
   * Each hint must be assigned a different number. Since the secret codes are always 3 different numbers, you have to pick a different number for each hint.
   * During the first round you can only guess on your own hint, as you have no information about the enemy's words. In subsequent rounds you must try to break the enemy's code too. Tips on how to do this are below.
3. Finally is the __results phase__. This is pretty straight forward. The results of the guesses are displayed, any any misses ‚ò†Ô∏è or hits üíæ are assigned. If either team gets two hits, or two misses, the game ends. Also, if this was round 8, the game ends as well. Scoring is detailed in the __Goal__ section above.

## __TIPS__
* Don't make the references so obscure that your team won't understand them. Otherwise you risk a miss ‚ò†Ô∏è. But don't make them so obvious that the other team will clearly understand what your secret word is, to prevent them from getting a hit üíæ.
* Watching the history is critical to uncovering the other teams secret words, and decoding their messages. Since you don't know the words associated with each hint, you can view what they wrote down to try to guess what they meant. In the screenshot up top, you can see that "Elephant Trunk" was in Red's #1 column... Could trunk have anything to do with the steering wheel hint displayed above? Maybe their secret word has something to do with a car? As more rounds go by and more history is produced, you can use this to find patterns.
