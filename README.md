# PlaThyme
It is a multiplayer web game hosting site. We are aiming to create a website where users can select a game, create a private room and start playing games. The site shall be able to host open source games created by contributors. Initially we are aiming on making one game collaboratively. This will help us nail down the creation process, and create documentation for it. Following this, additional games will be created, each with each of the games being created individually by each of the initial contributors.

* first game creation: __Draw the Word__
* Future work: Additional game ideas: 
  1 __Draw the word, down the line__
  2 __Enigma Breaker__


# __Draw the Word__ 
will be a game where one player will use a virtual canvas to draw a secret word given to them. Other players will then guess the word in a chat module. String recognition will watch for the correct answer, and award a point to the player whose guessed it correctly. This will require the following things to be made:
* Shared virtual canvas, which one player at a time may modify.
* Chat integration.
* String recognition for awarding points.
* Scoreboard.
* Create multiple rooms based on shareable code.
* Handle new player join / exit.
* Game encapsulation, so adding additional games will be easier.
* Writing documentation on game creation process.

# __Future game ideas__
## __Draw the word, down the line__
A version of draw the word where players alternately draw, and guess the content of other people's drawings.

## __Enigma Breaker__
A word game where teams of players try to pass secret message codes while the other team listens.
